This is the new (Oct 2023), official data archive site for WikiPathways, replacing the site previously hosted on wmcloud. 

## Content
We serve that last 12 months of content here as GH Pages. We also archive everything at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/wikipathways/search?page=1&size=20).
